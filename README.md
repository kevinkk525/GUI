This library was created by Igor Timofeev but is now only supported in his MineOS so I pulled everything and made his updates compatible to OpenOS again.

Loading .pic images doesn't work, readings are always empty..

Install by running: pastebin run EVWjkBxg
Or download the install.lua file from the repository. They are identical.
